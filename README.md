How the game is played?
    In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
    at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the
    ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using
    the spacebar. When the game begins, a ﬂeet of aliens ﬁlls the
    sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots
    and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a
    new ﬂeet appears that moves faster than the previous ﬂeet. If
    any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the
    screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships,
    the game ends.
